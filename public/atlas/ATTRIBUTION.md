Adaptations: axes and units converted from millimeters/Z-up to meters/Y-up; translated to rest at the stage; geometry simplified using meshoptimizer with 0.2% relative error limit per structure; normals quantized to signed 16-bit; packed into binary chunks; curated display system groupings and colors. The source contains 2,234 individual OBJ meshes; all remain represented. The combined hierarchy contains 3,432 named FMA concepts, which may reference multiple meshes. Original source identity is preserved in the manifest.

Source OBJ comments mention an older CC BY-SA 2.1 Japan license. The official current database license linked above supersedes that legacy text and explicitly permits redistribution and adaptation under CC BY 4.0.

BodyParts3D represents an adult male reference anatomy based on TARO MRI and anatomical illustration refinements. It is not a complete model of every possible human anatomical structure or variation. This interface is educational and is not a clinical tool.

Adaptations: translated native meter/Y-up coordinates onto the stage, coincident vertices welded and source normals averaged, geometry simplified with a 0.2% per-structure relative error bound, and normals quantized. Colors and display systems are curated for this interface. All 888 source meshes are represented, with 1,073 source nodes available as selectable individual or compound concepts.

This is a reference assembly with whole-body surface and selected organs, including female reproductive anatomy. Its skeleton and muscle coverage is partial. It is not a complete model of every human structure or a single-person scan. Eight placenta/umbilical structures are classified under Pregnancy reference and hidden by default.

## Biology with Hamza integration

Viewer engine adapted from https://github.com/ashemag/human-atlas (MIT, copyright 2026 ashemag). Original license: licenses/HUMAN-ATLAS-MIT.txt. Changes: new website UI; region filters; keyboard-accessible view and zoom controls; independent canvas fitting; gzip-only distribution with decoder fallback. Geometry is unchanged from the compressed upstream release.

Compatibility view: geometry reduced using meshoptimizer with a 2.5% per-mesh relative error bound; quantized to 0.01 mm coordinate precision and displayed with a custom Canvas 2D software renderer. All source structure identities are retained. Fine anatomical detail is reduced.
